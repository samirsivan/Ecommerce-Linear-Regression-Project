# Ecommerce-Linear-Regression-Project
Problem Statement:

As a data scientist with a New York City-based ecommerce company that sells clothing online. In addition to their online sales, they offer in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers can visit the store, consult with a personal stylist, and then place their orders either through a mobile app or the website. The company is currently evaluating whether to prioritize their mobile app or website experience, and they've brought you on board to assist in making this decision.
